# Jarvis - Your Intelligent Car Assistant
Step into the future with JARVIS, your very own personal assistant on the road! Inspired by the legendary Iron Man's AI companion, our team has brought the magic of AI to your car, making your driving experience safer, smoother, and more delightful than ever before.



# Introducing JARVIS: Your Intelligent Car Assistant

Let's delve into what JARVIS can do:

* JARVIS listens for commands from the car owner upon recognizing their face. Through a single photo, JARVIS can memorize faces using a one-shot memorization model (Siamese networks). These networks encode the face, compare it with new faces, and apply a contrastive function to determine familiarity.

* After authentication, JARVIS listens for and processes commands using a speech-to-text model. In this phase, JARVIS employs a distinct approach, opting for methods other than NLP for processing voice commands. However, NLP integration is planned for implementation in the next version.

* JARVIS boasts numerous capabilities:

    * Browsing Google based on user queries.
    * Opening YouTube videos based on user requests.
    * Fetching weather data from online sources.

* JARVIS responds via voice using a text-to-speech model. Many more functions can be added later based on user preferences and benefits.

* Furthermore, JARVIS features a back camera utilizing YOLOv8 for detecting objects behind the car, including humans, cars, and other obstacles. This feature is currently under development.

* For enhanced driver safety, a face landmark detection model continuously monitors for signs of driver fatigue, particularly eye closure. If a certain threshold is exceeded, an alarm is triggered.

* In conclusion, the current version of JARVIS is just a prototype. Its potential for growth and innovation knows no bounds, promising an exciting future ahead.
